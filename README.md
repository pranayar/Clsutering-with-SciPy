# Clsutering-with-SciPy
SciPy is a Python library for scientific computing that provides modules for optimization, linear algebra, integration, interpolation, and other tasks commonly used in scientific and engineering projects. It also includes a submodule for clustering, which provides a variety of methods for grouping similar data points together. Some of the most used clustering methods in SciPy include:

K-Means: a popular method for partitioning a dataset into a fixed number of clusters..

Hierarchical: a method that creates a hierarchical representation of the data, where each cluster is a subset of the previous one.

DBSCAN: a density-based method that groups together points that are close to each other in the feature space.

Spectral: a method based on the eigenvectors of a similarity matrix of the data.

Affinity Propagation: a method that propagates the similarity between data points to find clusters.
